# Component Testing with Cypress in React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using TypeScript.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `yarn start`: Run the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). 🚀

- `yarn test`: **Launch all levels of tests in interactive watch mode. Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are mandatory to ensure comprehensive testing coverage.** Check [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more info. 🧪

- `yarn build`: Build the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode for optimal performance. 🛠️

- `yarn cy:open`: Open Cypress, the end-to-end testing framework. Run functional tests interactively. 🕶️

**Note: Eject is a one-way operation. Use it only if you're ready to customize build configuration.**
